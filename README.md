This project is my main post-graduate work from 2018.7 to 2019.8. 
the main ideas are copy from ORB-SLAM2's author.
the ORB-SLAM2's adress: https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2.git
but in the file of the project i don't cite the license:

my main work is about: monocular pose measurement base on triangular surface modeling of non-cooperative targets.

CS_IR_3MP.yaml: this is camera internal parameters and some viewer windows parameters, so on.

usage: ./motion_struct video_path ORBvoc.txt camera_internal_parameters_path

the ORBvoc.txt can download from ORB-SLAM2.
